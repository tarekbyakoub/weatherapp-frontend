# Weather or not

A simple weather application for browsers built using react and redux. Will give some suggestions on how to prepare for the day based on the weather (more suggestions still to be added.) By default will fetch your current location (You have to allow it to access your location), otherwise can be overridden by searching for a location. Users can store locations as favourites and easily access them from the favourites dashboard.

A work in progress, so any improvements or constructive feedback is appreciated!
